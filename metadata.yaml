description: '""Now this here planet, "" he said cautiously, ""is whacky in a lot
  of ways. First of all they call it Mert. Just plain Mert. And they live in houses
  strictly from Dickens, all carriages, no sewers, narrow streets, stuff like that.""
  But that wasn''t all ... Travis, in reaching Diomed III before any others, found
  himself waging a one-man fight against more than this; he was bucking the strangest
  way of life you have ever heard of!'
